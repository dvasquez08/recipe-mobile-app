# Pocket Recipe

This is the mobile version of the sime recipe app that I created for the web. I initially had the same concept for the mobile verions but I built the app, and learned more about what I can do with the Spoonacular API, I decided to push it further and make it much more helpful. This is a more complex version of the app and I am very proud of it. It is still in the works. It is almost complete except for one hiccup that I'm working on. 

## How it Works

The interface is simple. The main page explains how the app works and explains to the user how to use the app. You type in the list of ingredients that you have in the text box, then press "Get Recipes." You are then taken to a page where it shows the list of possible dishes you can make using the ingredients you entered.

Once you make your selection, you're taken to another page that shows an additional list of variants of that dish that you selected along with pictures. Tap "Full Recipe" button under the one you choose and a dialog box will appear that shows the recipe name, the ingredients you will need, and cooking instructions.  

## What's left

The whole app works however there are some recipe titles that are empty from Spoonacular's side. This is a known issue however I'm working on the error handling. I would like it to either now show the recipe title at all when the app pulls the list of recipes to make, or when the user taps on the recipe title that has no data, an error message appears explaining that this recipe title has no data. I'm having a tough time with it but I'll keep pushing through and hopefully get that going soon!
